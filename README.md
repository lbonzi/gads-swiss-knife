# GAds Swiss Knife

## Overview

GAds Swiss Knife is a powerful Chrome extension designed to automate the task of dismissing all recommendations in your Google Ads account with just one click. The extension supports multiple languages and provides a fun and engaging experience by playing music and displaying fireworks while the recommendations are being dismissed.

I plan to release other "tools" in future updates for this extension to try improve the experience in GAds :)
